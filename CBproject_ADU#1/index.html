            <h1>Global citizen with low vision</h1>

           <p>These	 days,	 Singapore	 is	 a	 center	 of	 the	 world,	
            and	 Vishnu	 is	 one	 of	 its	 global	 citizens.	 After	
            graduating	 from	 one	 of	 India’s	 technology	
            colleges,	 he	 went	 to	 a	 postgraduate	 program	 at	
            the	National	University	 of	Malaysia.	His	 work	 on	
            visualizing	 data	 landed	 him	 a	 job	 with	 a	
            multinational	 medical	 technology	 company.	
            Vishnu	 was	 diagnosed	 with	 glaucoma	 and	 his	
            eyes	 have	 been	 ge?ng	 steadily	 worse,	 despite	
            treatment.	 He	 can	 adjust	 his	 monitor	 and	 his	
            phone,	 but	 many	 of	 the	 technical	 programs	 he	
            uses	don’t	have	many	options,	 so	he	has	 started	
            using	a	screen	magnifier	and	high-contrast	mode.	
            He	has	several	mobile	phones.	One	connects	him	
            to	his	 family	in	India,	one	is	 for	work,	and	one	is	
            for	 personal	 use.	 He’s	 lucky	 to	 have	 good	
            bandwidth	 at	 home	 and	 at	 work.	 Some	 of	 his	
            colleagues	 from	 the	university	live	in	places	with	
            much	 more	 erratic	 connections.	 Even	 so,	
            downloading	 large	 pages	 from	 European	 or	 U.S.	
            servers	 can	 be	 slow.	 But,	 if	 he	 had	 one	 wish,	 it	
            would	 be	 that	 people	 would	 write	 technical	
            papers	 and	 websites	 more	 clearly.	 His	 English	 is	
            good,	but	idiomatic	expressions	can	still	be	hard.	</p>
